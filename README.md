# Test-work
This is simple test work, I got on one interview. 
The task was:
-design the model to store in the database
-create a simple input/output interface
-realise an algorithm to calculate the shortest distance between the stations you choose.
-show to user some route, final cost and some other details

I chose the simpliest algorithm of Floyd-Warshall
